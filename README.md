# IoT_Device_Category_Classification_System_using_Advanced_Deep_Learning_Techniques
The Internet of Things (IoT), which allows household appliances, cameras, and other devices to communicate
and interact with one another, has brought about a dramatic
transformation in today’s technological world. Due to the transmission of sensitive data between the devices, the security and
protection of this data is a problem that requires extreme caution
to resolve. A fundamental worry in today’s IoT security is the
need for a mechanism or a method to distinguish between types
of IoT devices in a network traffic. So, in this research, we
aim at developing a novel framework for classifying different
types of IoT devices in a network using advanced deep learning
techniques. The dataset utilised to train the neural network model
was the “IoT device identification” dataset. Additionally,
a comparative study between the proposed neural networkbased model with other state-of-the-art classical machine learning
models is also presented. The proposed pipeline has been shown
to surpass state-of-the-art methods in recognising the kind of
device on various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision,
computation time and misclassification rate. Further, comparison
of model performance based on features extraction techniques
and optimizer used for the neural network model is also presented
in this research.
